# MRI Brain Tumour Classification and Segmentation using ResNet

This project utilises a pre-trained ResNet NN to classify and segment brain tumours in MRI scans - heavily inspired and adapted from https://github.com/sachin365123/MRI-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-ResUNet-Deep-Learning-Architecture-/tree/main, with my own additions on the data exploration, model training, custom loss functions, data visualisation and bug fixes. 

TO BE COMPLETED 

The figure below shows the results from a trained classification and segmentation model. From left to right: 
- The original MRI scan
- The ground truth and AI predicted masks overlayed
- The ground truth mask overlayed on the MRI
- The predicted mask overlayed on the MRI
- The difference between the truth and predicted overlayed on the MRI
